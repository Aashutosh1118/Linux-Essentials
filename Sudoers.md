# Understanding and Configuring the `/etc/sudoers` File in Linux

This guide provides an overview of the `/etc/sudoers` file in Linux, explaining how to safely edit it using `visudo`, understand its content, and configure user privileges and environment settings.

---

## Viewing the `/etc/sudoers` File

The `/etc/sudoers` file defines which users or groups have the right to use `sudo` to execute commands with elevated privileges.

To view all active entries in the `sudoers` file without comments or empty lines:

```
cat /etc/sudoers | grep -E -v "^(#|$)"
```

---

## Safely Editing the `sudoers` File

Editing the `sudoers` file directly can be risky due to potential syntax errors that could lock you out of administrative privileges. Always use the `visudo` command to edit this file.

### Using `visudo`

```
visudo
```

**Or specify your preferred editor:**

```
EDITOR=vim visudo
```

- **`visudo`**: Opens the `sudoers` file in a safe environment, performing syntax checking upon saving.
- **`EDITOR=vim`**: Sets the editor to `vim` for this session.

**Note**: `visudo` ensures that only one user edits the `sudoers` file at a time and prevents syntax errors.

## Understanding the `sudoers` File Content

### Default Options (`Defaults`)

The `Defaults` settings control various aspects of `sudo`'s behavior.

#### Password Prompt Settings

- **`Defaults !visiblepw`**: Prevents `sudo` from echoing asterisks (*) when typing passwords, enhancing security against shoulder surfing.

#### Environment Settings

- **`Defaults always_set_home`**: Sets the `HOME` environment variable to the target user's home directory.
- **`Defaults match_group_by_gid`**: Matches groups by their Group ID (GID) rather than group name.
- **`Defaults always_query_group_plugin`**: Always queries the group plugin when determining group membership.
- **`Defaults env_reset`**: Resets the environment to a clean state before executing commands.

#### Preserving Environment Variables

Specify environment variables to keep:

```
Defaults env_keep = "COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS"
Defaults env_keep += "MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE"
Defaults env_keep += "LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY"
```

#### Secure Path

Set a secure `PATH` for `sudo` commands:

```
Defaults secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
```

This prevents users from running unauthorized executables by restricting the directories searched for commands.

#### Authentication Timeout

Control how long `sudo` caches your credentials:

```
Defaults timestamp_timeout=5
```

- Sets the timeout to 5 minutes.
- After this period, `sudo` will prompt for a password again.

---

## Password Requirements

Configure whether `sudo` requires a password and whose password is needed.

- **`Defaults targetpw`**: Requires the password of the target user (e.g., `root`).
- **`Defaults rootpw`**: Requires the root password.
- **`Defaults runaspw`**: Requires the password of the user specified by `-u`.

**To disable these requirements:**

```
Defaults !targetpw
Defaults !rootpw
Defaults !runaspw
```

---

## Defining Aliases

Aliases allow grouping for users, hosts, runas users, and commands.

### User Aliases

```
User_Alias ADMINS = alice, bob, carol
```

### Host Aliases

```
Host_Alias WEB_SERVERS = www1, www2, www3
```

### Runas Aliases

```
Runas_Alias OP_USERS = operator, sysadmin
```

### Command Aliases

```
Cmnd_Alias MAINTENANCE = /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/journalctl
```

---

## User Privilege Specifications

Define what commands users or groups can execute.

### Basic Syntax

```
user    hostlist = (runas_user : runas_group) taglist commandlist
```

- **`user`**: User or `%group` the rule applies to.
- **`hostlist`**: Hostnames where the rule applies.
- **`runas_user`**: User to run the command as.
- **`runas_group`**: Group to run the command as.
- **`taglist`**: Optional tags like `NOPASSWD`, `NOEXEC`.
- **`commandlist`**: Commands the user is allowed to run.

### Examples

- Allow `alice` to run all commands as any user:

  ```
  alice ALL=(ALL) ALL
  ```

- Allow members of `ADMINS` to run maintenance commands without a password:

  ```
  %ADMINS ALL=(OP_USERS) NOPASSWD: MAINTENANCE
  ```

- Allow `bob` to restart the web server as `root`:

  ```
  bob WEB_SERVERS=(root) /usr/sbin/systemctl restart httpd
  ```

---

## Special Tags and Defaults

### Tags

- **`PASSWD`**: Require a password (default behavior).
- **`NOPASSWD`**: Do not require a password.
- **`NOEXEC`**: Prevent commands from executing further commands.
- **`EXEC`**: Allow commands to execute other commands.
- **`SETENV`**: Allow the user to set environment variables.
- **`NOSETENV`**: Prevent setting environment variables.

### Applying Tags

```
dave ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
```

---

## Group-Based Directives

- **`%groupname`**: References a Unix group.

### Examples

- Allow all members of the `sudo` group to run any command:

  ```
  %sudo ALL=(ALL) ALL
  ```

- Allow `webadmins` group to manage the web server:

  ```
  %webadmins ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/systemctl restart httpd
  ```

---

## Using Runas Specification

Specify the user and group to run commands as.

### Syntax

```
user hostlist = (runas_user : runas_group) commandlist
```

- If `runas_user` or `runas_group` is omitted, `root` and the invoking user's group are assumed, respectively.

### Example

- Allow `jane` to run commands as `dbadmin` and group `dbgroup`:

  ```
  jane ALL=(dbadmin:dbgroup) /usr/bin/psql
  ```

- Usage:

  ```
  sudo -u dbadmin -g dbgroup psql
  ```

---

## Checking Sudo Privileges with `sudo -l`

You can verify your current `sudo` privileges using the `sudo -l` command. This is useful to determine what commands you are allowed to execute with `sudo`.

### Usage

```
sudo -l
```

This command will list the commands you are permitted to run, according to the rules specified in the `/etc/sudoers` file.

### Example

If your user `alice` runs:

```
sudo -l
```

She might see:

```
User alice may run the following commands on this host:
    (ALL) ALL
```

This indicates that `alice` can run all commands as any user.

Alternatively, if specific commands are permitted, they will be listed accordingly.

---
##  SUID vs `sudo`

### SUID (Set User ID)

- **Usage**: Set on executable files to allow users to run them with the file owner's permissions.
- **Limitations**:
  - Less flexibleâ€”applies to individual files.
  - Potential security risks if misconfigured.
  - No logging or auditing.

### `sudo`

- **Usage**: Grants users permission to run commands as other users per `sudoers` rules.
- **Advantages**:
  - Highly configurable.
  - Allows fine-grained control.
  - Provides logging and auditing.
  - More secure when properly configured.
